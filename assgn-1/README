Makefile - make build system file.
out.txt - output of execution on eecslinab3 server.
README - this file.

Run
> make all

ORIGINALITY:
The contents of this package are 100% original and composed of my own work.
No code was copied, modified, or referred to in the writing of this project.

Some given functions (cuserid) were replaced with other alternatives (getpwuid)
in my implementation due to deprecation messages in the MAN pages or unexpected
behavior. I suspect that the assignment prompts may be slightly out of date or
have minor inconsistencies.
