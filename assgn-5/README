Requires build-essential package on Ubuntu
Or standard build utils on other unix like systems.

BUILDING:
Run
> make all

ORIGINALITY:
The contents of this package are 100% original and composed of my own work.
No code was copied, modified, or referred to in the writing of this project.



PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:

I was unsure about the intended meaning of some of the assignment prompts
so I made a few assumptions. I assumed that we were to create 100+
threads that executed JUST ONE transaction. I also assumed that transaction
amounts could be randomly generated as well.

***NOTES:

As far as I know, the project 100% holds up the requirements. The application
does not always terminate, however, this is not a bug, but simply because the
balance is less than is required to pay all of the pending withdrawals.
